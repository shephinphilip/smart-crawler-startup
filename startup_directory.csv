The desire for a healthier yet delicious snacking option led two friends to create something truly unique—Oh! Nuts. More than just a brand, it represents a shift in the snacking industry, offering a perfect balance of taste and nutrition. What started as a simple yet innovative idea—crafting chips directly from real nuts—has grown into a movement redefining the way people snack.

Oh! Nuts delivers a guilt-free indulgence with non-fried, gluten-free, and protein-rich chips that contain 70% less oil than traditional snacks and are completely free from preservatives. Each pack is designed to provide an optimal daily intake of nuts, making every bite both enjoyable and nutritionally fulfilling. With Oh! Nuts, snacking is no longer a compromise but a delightful and healthy experience.

The overwhelming response from consumers and retailers has fueled our rapid expansion into the market. Since our launch, Oh!

Our strategic partnerships has further strengthened our offline distribution, ensuring that our products are readily available to a growing audience. With each new point of sale, we are inching closer to our vision of making nutritious snacking accessible to all.

Our journey has been met with industry recognition and invaluable support. Oh!

Additionally, we were awarded a grant under the Startup India Seed Fund Scheme, reinforcing the belief in our vision and enabling us to scale with confidence. These milestones serve as a testament to our commitment to innovation and quality in the food space.

Oh! Nuts is more than just a snack—it's a statement. A statement that healthy eating should never come at the cost of taste, and that better choices should be available to everyone. As we continue to grow, we remain dedicated to transforming the snacking industry, one delicious, nutrient-packed bite at a time.",https://www.ohnuts.in

The unsolved problems of young parents and their kids' drink
Children want to drink some tea or tea-like beverage along with their parents, when parents drink their tea.
This scenario has been repeated for generations.
We, BARNAA, exist to provide solutions for caffeine-free children's tea.

There is a lack of specific tea or tea-like beverage suitable for children; either it is not available or not made in the market. Though children want to drink some tea or tea-like beverage along with their parents, when parents drink their tea,. It is common for children, in many houses, to show a strong interest in tea when they see their parents enjoying a cup of tea. Some children express curiosity, while others can be quite persistent, eager to emulate their parents and partake in the tea-drinking ritual. With few alternatives available, parents sometimes feel forced to give their children unhealthy choices. Many resort to diluting their own tea with milk to satisfy their children's curiosity, or they offer sugary drinks available in the market as a substitute. These drinks are high in sugar, caffeine, and artificial ingredients, potentially leading to issues like obesity and hyperactivity. This scenario has been repeated for generations, with most of us having experienced the same longing for tea during childhood, only to be told to wait until we were older. The challenge lies in the fact that, despite children's desire to drink tea, there is no tea specifically designed for them available on the market. WE are generations of health-conscious parents. Increasing awareness among parents about the negative impact of sugary and caffeinated beverages, leading to a demand for healthier alternatives. BARNAA exists to provide solutions to caffeine-free children's tea, a healthy, nutritious beverage, made by blending plant-based superfoods, herbs, and spices, with zero added sugar, specifically designed and suitable for children. One-stop solution for tea for all family members.

Introduction
IC Fitness Club is a leading fitness education and training platform in India, committed to raising industry standards by providing high-quality education and professional fitness training. Founded by Deepak Bhardwaj, a former Mr. Delhi bodybuilder and experienced personal trainer, the platform focuses on bridging the gap between clients and educated personal trainers.

Vision & Mission
The Indian fitness industry struggles with two significant challenges:

Unqualified Trainers: Many trainers lack formal education in exercise science and human anatomy, leading to incorrect training methods and injuries such as golfer's elbow, tennis elbow, shoulder impingement, and slipped discs.

Finding the Right Trainer: Clients often struggle to find personal trainers who have the knowledge and expertise to design effective, personalized workout programs.

IC Fitness Club is on a mission to solve these challenges by offering structured education and professional certifications that create a network of well-trained, science-backed fitness professionals.

Fitness Science Academy: Empowering Trainers with Knowledge
Since 2021, IC Fitness Club has successfully operated its Fitness Science Academy in Dwarka Mor, Delhi, which provides world-class training in:

📌 Certified Personal Trainer (CPT) Course – Focuses on human anatomy, biomechanics, exercise science, strength training, and client assessment.
📌 Sports Nutrition Certification – Covers macronutrients, micronutrients, diet planning, and performance nutrition for athletes and fitness enthusiasts.
📌 Injury Prevention & Rehabilitation – Helps trainers and clients understand common gym injuries, corrective exercises, and recovery techniques.

These certifications equip trainers with scientific knowledge to help clients achieve results safely and effectively.

Gymploy.com: India's First Fitness Recruitment Platform
IC Fitness Club launched Gymploy.com, India's first dedicated fitness recruitment platform, to connect personal trainers with gym organizations across the country.

- Trainers – Certified professionals can find job opportunities in reputed gyms.
- Gym Owners – Can hire qualified trainers with verified credentials.

This initiative ensures higher industry standards by helping gyms recruit educated professionals rather than untrained individuals.

Why IC Fitness Club Stands Out?
Unlike many fitness startups that rely on marketing gimmicks, IC Fitness Club is built on real-world experience and scientific knowledge. Deepak Bhardwaj and his team personally test all fitness methodologies before teaching them to others.

Key Differentiators:
✔ Science-Backed Training: Unlike many unqualified trainers, IC Fitness Club follows evidence-based principles in fitness and nutrition.
✔ Industry Experts as Trainers: Every instructor at IC Fitness Club has years of hands-on experience in personal training, bodybuilding, and sports nutrition.
✔ Recruitment Support for Trainers: Gymploy.com ensures that qualified trainers get hired in top fitness organizations.

LawSeek,Mr. Harsh Panwar,Director,[email protected],"At LawSeek, we're redefining how startups and lawyers tackle legal challenges in a fast-paced world. For startups, we're the ultimate legal co-founder—delivering AI-powered tools to solve everyday hurdles like crafting agreements, running legal health checks, and managing cap tables. For lawyers, we're the smart assistant that automates workflows and connects you with clients, so you can focus on what truly matters: strategy and impact.

Startups: Sort Legals, Scale Fearlessly

Founders shouldn't lose sleep over legal complexities. Whether you're incorporating, ensuring compliance, or raising funds, LawSeek has your back. Our automated tools—like the Agreement Creator, Legal Health Check, and Cap Table Management—turn daunting processes into seamless steps. Tired of the old way? The endless paperwork, costly consultations, and fragmented advice? We replace that chaos with clarity. Raise a request, and our network of lawyers, CAs, and CSs steps in for strategic support when you need it most. With LawSeek, you innovate—we shield your legals.

Imagine this: Priya, a startup founder, dreams of launching her app. But legal roadblocks—incorporation delays, compliance gaps, equity confusion—slow her down. She discovers LawSeek. Our AI crafts her agreements in minutes, audits her legal health, and models her cap table effortlessly. When she needs expert advice, we connect her to a trusted lawyer. Priya launches on time, fearless and compliant. That's the LawSeek way: you solve problems, we sort your legals.

Lawyers: Practice Smarter, Not Harder

Legal work shouldn't drown you in paperwork. LawSeek empowers lawyers with AI-driven tools to automate the routine—think document drafting, case management, and e-filing—while our advanced research tools deliver insights faster. Managing deadlines, billing clients, or chasing follow-ups? We streamline it all, so you can dedicate your expertise to strategy and clients. Plus, our platform connects you with startups seeking your skills, growing your practice effortlessly. Your expertise, our technology—unstoppable together.

Picture this: Arjun, a lawyer, juggles cases but spends hours on repetitive tasks. Enter LawSeek. Our AI drafts contracts flawlessly, organizes his caseload, and automates filings. Research that took hours now takes minutes. He bills clients with a click and meets a startup founder through our network. Arjun wins back time for courtroom wins and client wins. That's LawSeek: you strategize, we automate.

Why LawSeek?

Unlike traditional tools—slow, expensive, fragmented—LawSeek is your all-in-one legal OS. Startups get clarity and compliance at a fraction of the cost (think Klarna's simplicity, not SBI's red tape). Lawyers get efficiency and growth without the grind. Inspired by innovators like Atlassian and Revolut, we blend intuitive design with cutting-edge tech. Our DNA? Answers for the layman, automation for the lawman.

OCEANLUX CCU TECHNOLOGIES PRIVATE LIMITED,Mr. Gaurav Raghav,Gaurav Raghav,[email protected],"Oceanlux CCU: Pioneering the Future of Clean Air & Carbon Capture

Introduction
Oceanlux CCU is a deep-tech startup at the forefront of Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) and clean air technology. We are incubated at MNIT Jaipur and iCreate and are developing breakthrough solutions to combat urban air pollution and climate change. Our innovative OceanTree system is a first-of-its-kind microalgae-based air purification and carbon removal technology that works on artificial photosynthesis, actively removing CO₂ and other pollutants 24/7 while generating oxygen.

With rising concerns over indoor and outdoor air quality, OceanTree is positioned as a sustainable alternative to traditional air purifiers, aligning with India's National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), CCUS policy, Green Building standards, and the National Bio-Energy Mission.

Technology Behind OceanTree
At the heart of Oceanlux CCU's innovation is artificial photosynthesis, a nature-inspired technology that mimics how trees and plants absorb CO₂ and release oxygen. OceanTree uses specially cultivated high-efficiency microalgae, which are several times more effective than trees in capturing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen.

💡 Key Features of OceanTree:
✅ Removes CO₂, VOCs, PM2.5, PM10, and other pollutants in real time
✅ Generates oxygen equivalent to six mature trees
✅ Works 24x7, unlike natural trees, which only photosynthesize during the day
✅ Modular & Scalable, making it suitable for both indoor and outdoor applications
✅ Self-sustaining & energy-efficient, ensuring low operational costs

The Problem: A Global Air Quality Crisis
Air pollution is a silent killer, with over 99% of the global population breathing unhealthy air (WHO, 2023). Urban spaces such as offices, airports, hotels, hospitals, metro stations, and shopping malls suffer from high indoor CO₂ levels (often exceeding 2000 ppm), leading to:

🔴 Reduced productivity & cognitive function
🔴 Increased health risks—respiratory issues, headaches, fatigue
🔴 Poor air quality impacting well-being in Tier 1 & Tier 2 cities
🔴 Traditional air purifiers only removing dust—not CO₂ or harmful gases

Current solutions fail to address the root cause—CO₂ and toxic gas accumulation—leaving urban populations vulnerable to deteriorating air quality.

The Solution: OceanTree – The Future of Clean Air
OceanTree goes beyond air purification—it transforms air quality by actively removing pollutants and replenishing oxygen.

🌱 Designed for Smart Cities & Green Buildings:
✔ Indoor & Outdoor Applications – Ideal for offices, metro stations, malls, schools, gyms, and hospitals.
✔ Meets National & International Standards – Aligns with NCAP, Green Building Certifications, and CCUS initiatives.
✔ A Natural Replacement for Air Purifiers – While air purifiers only filter dust, OceanTree removes CO₂, VOCs, and airborne toxins.

🌿 Scalable for Urban Sustainability:
🔹 Single-unit impact = Six trees 🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳
🔹 Multiple units create an “Urban Forest” effect
🔹 Helps cities & industries achieve decarbonization goals

Market Size & Opportunity
The global air purification market is expected to reach $30 billion by 2030, with rising demand from urbanization, corporate wellness programs, and government sustainability policies.

🏙️ Market Segments OceanTree Targets:
1️⃣ Indoor Air Quality & Green Buildings – $15B+ market potential
2️⃣ Carbon Capture & Decarbonization – Growing at 20% CAGR
3️⃣ Smart Cities & Infrastructure Projects – Rising investments globally
4️⃣ Healthcare & Wellness Industry – Hospitals, gyms, and offices investing in clean air solutions

With rapid urbanization, climate policies, and increasing awareness of air pollution's health impact, Oceanlux CCU is positioned to become a market leader in sustainable air purification and CCUS solutions.

parshwanath health consultancy llp,Dr. DHIRAJ KARNAWAT,FOUNDER,[email protected],"Chqup: Transforming OPD Health Insurance in 1000 words.
Introduction
Healthcare access in India is often constrained by financial barriers, especially for outpatient department (OPD) services. Many people delay or avoid medical consultations due to high out-of-pocket expenses. Chqup is a startup dedicated to solving this issue by providing affordable OPD health insurance plans specifically designed for women. By ensuring cost-effective access to specialist consultations, diagnostic tests, and preventive healthcare, Chqup empowers women to take charge of their health while reducing financial stress.
The Problem Chqup Addresses-Healthcare expenses in India are primarily out-of-pocket, with OPD visits and diagnostic tests accounting for a significant share. Many women, especially in middle- and lower-income groups, avoid visiting doctors due to financial constraints. As a result, minor health issues escalate into chronic diseases, leading to prolonged suffering and increased medical costs. Furthermore, preventive healthcare is often overlooked, increasing the burden on both individuals and the healthcare system. Chqup aims to bridge this gap by making OPD healthcare affordable and accessible to all women.
Chqup's Unique Approach
Unlike traditional health insurance plans that primarily cover hospitalization, Chqup focuses on outpatient care. The key differentiators of Chqup's model include:
1.	Women-Centric Plans – Tailored health coverage addressing common OPD needs for women across different age groups.
2.	Affordable Pricing – Cost-effective plans ensuring access to essential medical services.
3.	Easy Accessibility – Direct partnerships with pharmacists to distribute insurance plans, eliminating the need for complex paperwork.
4.	Preventive Healthcare Focus – Coverage for regular check-ups, diagnostic tests, and screenings to encourage early detection and treatment.
5.	Offline Marketing & Word-of-Mouth Strategy – Engaging with local communities through innovative, low-cost marketing strategies.
Target Audience & Market Strategy
Chqup primarily targets women aged 40 and above, categorized in five-year intervals up to 65 years. This demographic often experiences increasing healthcare needs but remains underserved by traditional health insurance models. Chqup's demand generation strategy revolves around:
•	Educating women about OPD coverage benefits.
•	Distributing flyers, pamphlets, and brochures near diagnostic centers and stores.
•	Leveraging free giveaways (such as sarees) to attract attention and spread awareness.
•	Collaborating with pharmacists as distributor partners who guide potential customers toward Chqup's plans.
Challenges and Solutions
Despite a well-structured strategy, Chqup has encountered hurdles, including:
1.	Restricted Access to Medical Institutions – Unable to place marketing materials inside diagnostic centers or train receptionists to promote plans. 
o	Solution: Focus on external distribution, direct pharmacist engagement, and public spaces for marketing.
2.	Lack of Referrals from Family Physicians – Revenue conflicts prevent doctors from recommending Chqup. 
o	Solution: Build trust through pharmacist referrals and customer testimonials to generate organic inquiries.
3.	Low Conversion from Health Camps – Mini health camps did not translate into significant sales. 
o	Solution: Shift towards targeted marketing efforts in high-footfall areas.
4.	Need for Patient-Initiated Inquiries at Pharmacies – Pharmacists need more direct engagement from potential customers. 
o	Solution: Increase community outreach efforts and incentivize pharmacists to promote Chqup actively.
Building Urgency and Desire for OPD Insurance
One of Chqup's primary challenges is making potential customers realize the need for OPD insurance before they face a medical crisis. Strategies to create urgency include:
•	Educating on Cost Savings: Highlighting how OPD insurance significantly reduces long-term healthcare expenses.
•	Real-Life Testimonials: Showcasing stories of women who benefited from early diagnosis and treatment through Chqup.
•	Seasonal Discounts & Limited-Time Offers: Encouraging immediate sign-ups through exclusive promotions.
•	Community Engagement Initiatives: Hosting informative sessions on women's health and preventive care.
Future Roadmap
To expand its impact and reach, Chqup plans to:
1.	Scale Distribution Partnerships – Expanding the network of pharmacists and local health influencers to drive sales.
2.	Leverage Digital Marketing – Incorporating online educational campaigns to complement offline marketing efforts.
3.	Develop Tiered Plans – Introducing varied pricing and benefit tiers to cater to different financial capacities.
4.	Enhance Customer Support – Establishing a dedicated helpline for inquiries and plan assistance.

Raheja Solar Food Processing Pvt. Ltd.,Mr. Yati Bajaj,Marketing Manager,[email protected],"The Indian food processing sector has witnessed remarkable growth over the years, contributing significantly to the nationâ€™s economy. With an annual growth rate of 7.3% between 2015 and 2022, this industry has played a crucial role in enhancing agricultural value addition, reducing post-harvest losses, and creating employment opportunities. At the heart of this transformation is Raheja Solar Food Processing (RSFP), a pioneer in sustainable food preservation through solar dehydration technology.
At Raheja Solar Food Processing (RSFP), we are committed to solving one of the most pressing challenges in agricultureâ€”post-harvest food loss. India, despite being one of the largest agricultural producers, faces a significant issue of food wastage due to inadequate storage and processing facilities. By leveraging solar-powered dehydration, we ensure that no farmerâ€™s hard work goes to waste.
Solar Drying: A Sustainable Solution for Farmers
RSFP designs and manufactures cutting-edge solar dryers that help farmers preserve their produce, reduce wastage, and increase profitability. Unlike conventional drying methods that are time-consuming and prone to contamination, our scientifically designed solar dryers offer a more efficient, hygienic, and sustainable solution. These dryers not only extend the shelf life of fresh produce but also help in retaining their natural color, taste, and nutritional valueâ€”aligning perfectly with the needs of health-conscious consumers
However, our mission extends beyond just providing equipment. We actively engage with farmers, training them on optimal solar drying techniques, guiding them on high-demand products, and offering a buyback policy that ensures they have a steady market for their dried produce. This decentralized approach empowers rural communities, especially women-led self-help groups (SHGs), by providing them with an independent and sustainable source of income.
From Solar-Dried Innovation to Market-Ready Products
Beyond manufacturing solar dryers, we have created a product line that embodies our sustainability vision. Using our solar-powered dehydration technology, RSFP produces natural, preservative-free dried fruits, vegetables, and herbs that cater to both B2B and B2C markets. Our process ensures that the produce retains maximum nutrition while achieving an extended shelf life without the need for artificial additives.
One of our flagship brands, Barefruit, is dedicated to offering 100% natural, solar-dried snacks made from farm-fresh fruits. These products contain no preservatives, no additivesâ€”just pure, sun-dried goodness, providing a guilt-free snacking option for conscious consumers.",https://www.rsfp.in/

Saif Automations Services LLP,Mr. Aliasgar Calcuttawala,Chief Technical Officer,[email protected],"Saif Seas emerged as a pioneering Def Tech startup in 2018, making its mark in India's defense sector through innovation and technological advancements. While the company's journey began with the prestigious iDEX DISC 1 Challenge, its most significant achievement has been its collaboration with the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) for the design, development, and delivery of high-end Unmanned Surface Vessels (USVs) capable of communicating with underwater assets.
Saif Seas' advancements in USV technology attracted the attention of DRDO, India's premier defense research institution. DRDO entrusted Saif Seas with a significant project—the development of next-generation USVs that would play a crucial role in naval operations by establishing seamless communication with submarines, underwater drones, and other submerged defense infrastructure.

This project represents a major leap in maritime defense capabilities, as it enables surface and underwater assets to operate in sync, enhancing naval intelligence and combat readiness. The USVs being developed by Saif Seas under this initiative are engineered to incorporate cutting-edge acoustic modems, real-time data transmission systems, and AI-powered autonomous navigation. These features ensure efficient and secure underwater communication, a critical requirement for modern naval warfare.

Furthermore, the USVs feature robust communication systems, high-efficiency propulsion mechanisms, and integrated AI-based navigation, making them ideal for naval and defense applications. The ability of these USVs to autonomously map and relay data to command centers enhances mission planning, threat detection, and real-time decision-making capabilities for the Indian defense forces.

The execution of this project demonstrates Saif Seas' ability to undertake complex defense contracts and deliver mission-critical solutions. It also reinforces the company's position as an industry leader in unmanned maritime systems, paving the way for future collaborations with the Indian defense establishment and international defense agencies.

Building on its technological expertise, Saif Seas ventured into a highly specialized domain—the development of Unmanned Surface Vessels (USVs). The company participated in the iDEX DISC 7 Challenge, which sought technological solutions for advanced naval operations. Saif Seas' capabilities in autonomous vessel design and maritime technology enabled it to secure a winning position in this challenge.

The USVs developed by Saif Seas feature intelligent, mission-capable designs that allow them to operate in both coastal and deep-sea environments, performing tasks such as reconnaissance, surveillance, hydrographic surveys, and search-and-rescue operations. The seamless integration of dual GNSS positioning, IMU sensors, and real-time AI navigation ensures that these crafts remain fully functional even in challenging conditions.

While the collaboration with DRDO marks Saif Seas' most high-profile engagement, its initial breakthrough came through the iDEX DISC 1 Challenge, where it successfully developed the Remote-Controlled Life Buoy for the Indian Navy. This state-of-the-art, battery-powered, self-propelled device was designed to enhance search and rescue missions, featuring a remote operational range of 1,000 meters, dual jet propulsion, and a lightweight design under 25 kg. The Indian Navy placed an order for 180 units, marking it as the first-ever product developed under iDEX to be inducted into active service.

Saif Seas' journey from a startup to a key defense technology provider is a testament to its commitment to innovation and excellence. While the Remote-Controlled Life Buoy marked its entry into the defense sector, its collaboration with DRDO and expertise in high-end USVs solidified its position as a leader in unmanned maritime technology.

By integrating advanced engineering, AI-driven automation, and real-time communication systems, Saif Seas is setting new benchmarks in the development of unmanned maritime assets. With a clear vision for the future, the company continues to push the boundaries of defense technology, ensuring that India remains at the forefront of maritime innovation. As Saif Seas expands its expertise and technological offerings, it is poised to play a crucial role in shaping the future of naval defense and autonomous maritime operations.",http://saifseas.com

VayuDrishti,Mr. Shakriya Pandey,CEO,[email protected],"About Us – VayuDrishti

At VayuDrishti, we envision a world where everyone breathes clean air—free from the invisible threats of pollution. Founded with a passion for environmental justice and technological innovation, VayuDrishti is a Nepali-born initiative committed to tackling one of humanity's most pressing challenges: air pollution. By combining real-time air monitoring and purification solutions, we are pioneering a movement toward cleaner, healthier, and more informed communities.

Our Mission

We are on a mission to make air quality visible, understandable, and actionable. Our integrated approach focuses on two pillars:

Accurate, Low-Cost Air Monitoring
Accessible, Effective Air Purification
By delivering end-to-end solutions—from monitoring to mitigation—we help individuals, institutions, and governments take meaningful action against air pollution.

What We Do

1. Air Quality Monitoring: Our flagship product is a low-cost, high-accuracy air quality monitoring system that tracks PM2.5, PM10, CO₂, temperature, humidity, ground ozone, and wind parameters in real time. Built for scalability and affordability, our device is ideal for urban neighborhoods, rural areas, schools, public offices, and industries. The data is visualized on our responsive dashboard and is also accessible through public APIs, enabling broader data-driven decisions.

2. Air Purification Systems: Recognizing that monitoring alone isn't enough, we've developed community-scale and indoor air purification systems. Designed specifically for Nepali environments, our purifiers reduce PM levels, neutralize harmful gases, and improve indoor air in classrooms, homes, hospitals, and offices. Our purification systems are energy-efficient, low-maintenance, and adaptable to various space sizes.

Together, these systems allow us to both diagnose and treat the problem of polluted air—making us a comprehensive air quality solution provider.

Why It Matters

Air pollution silently shortens lives, particularly in South Asia where millions are exposed to dangerously high levels of PM2.5. The lack of accessible monitoring and purification infrastructure limits awareness and response. At VayuDrishti, we close that gap. We equip communities with the knowledge and tools to see the problem and protect themselves from it.

Our solutions are not only technical—they are social. We focus on behavior change through education, data transparency, and community engagement.

The VayuDrishti Ecosystem

Monitoring Devices: Portable, easy-to-install units sending real-time data to our cloud.
Purifiers: Classroom-friendly, plug-and-play systems filtering particulate matter and VOCs.
Dashboard: Interactive platform displaying live AQI levels, trend graphs, alerts, and air health recommendations.
Workshops: Air quality literacy programs in schools, communities, and municipalities, empowering citizens to interpret and respond to air data.
AI-Driven Forecasting: Our upcoming platform will use AI models to forecast pollution levels and recommend personalized actions.
Values That Drive Us

Innovation with Purpose: We innovate not for complexity, but for clarity and accessibility.
Equity: We prioritize underserved regions, ensuring everyone has the right to breathe safely.
Sustainability: Our devices are energy-efficient, cost-effective, and designed for long-term use.
Transparency: We make our data open and understandable, believing knowledge is power.
Future Vision

VayuDrishti is scaling into an environmental intelligence company with a global footprint. Our roadmap includes:

Deployment of 10,000+ air monitors and 2,000+ purifiers by 2030
Smart home air quality systems integrated with IoT
AI-based health and pollution alerts tailored to individual exposure
Expansion into forest fire, dust storm, and transboundary pollution forecasting
As we grow, our focus remains grounded: cleaner air, better health, and empowered communities.

Wani Farming Tools Industry,Mr. Refaz Ahmad Wani,Director/Founder,[email protected],"The traditional tools used for hoeing, weeding and digging purposes are the Spade and Hoe. Both are equally important for a farmer. We developed a farming tool for this purpose and named it as “Spade and Hoe” as it is a 2 in 1 farming tool that can be used both as spade and hoe. All we need to do is to change the sharp edged tool and align it to the handle according to the purpose we are to use it for. Using the same tool reduces the cost as well. It saves the farmer's cost of buying the spade and hoe by 50%. Taking it in use also makes carriage easier as we need to carry only a single tool for different purposes. 
Explain USP (Unique Selling Proposition) of your product/service? Please focus on “benefits” rather than “features” of the technology.

Spade & Hoe is a two-in-one farming tool (it works as both as spade and hoe)

Yield Pro Earth Private Limited,Mr. Ram Mehta,Ram Mehta,[email protected],"Business Description for Yield Pro Earth
Right now, India has many small and marginalized farmers. Due to a shortage of funds and a lack of necessary irrigation facilities, farmers are still using the age-old trench techniques. Which in turn uses up a lot of electricity. Thus resulting in a huge waste of water and electricity. And so the Government has to give both water and electricity subsidies so that the farmers can do farming at a lower cost. This resulted in a huge loss to the government, which was the tune of crores of rupees. In the age of modernization, farmers in our country cannot have a definite count on their yield and can barely meet their own familyâ€™s needs. 
We have manufactured a Flexible Irrigation Pipe which is an economical, recyclable, sustainable, and easy-to-use irrigation pipe that can be directly attached to the water source. Unlike the traditional trench techniques and rigid water irrigation pipes which require a heavy investment as well as a fixed infrastructure around which the crops are to be grown or rotated. Also, the current rigid piping systems available in the market today, our product is 1/10th the cost and has no infrastructural requirement which makes it a more convenient and cheaper source of irrigation for the farmers with better results at a cheaper rate which in turn boosts the farmers profits.",https://www.shreeramagriplast.com
